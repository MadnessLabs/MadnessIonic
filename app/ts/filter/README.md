This folder should contain angular filters for your app.  The Enjin can assist in making filters by using the command below.

```gulp add-filter```

This will add the following files to your project:
```
app/ts/filter/${FILTER_NAME}.ts
``` 

You can find more info about filters in the Angular Docs link below:
