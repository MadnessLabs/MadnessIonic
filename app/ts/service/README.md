This folder should contain angular services for your app.  The Enjin can assist in making services by using the command below.

```gulp add-service```

This will add the following files to your project:
```
app/ts/service/${SERVICE_NAME}.ts
``` 

You can find more info about services in the Angular Docs link below:
