This folder should contain angular directive (component) templates for your app.  The Enjin can assist in making components by using the command below.

```gulp add-component```

This will add the following files to your project:
```
app/jade/directive/${COMPONENT_NAME}.jade
app/scss/directive/${COMPONENT_NAME}.scss
app/ts/directive/${COMPONENT_NAME}.ts
``` 

You can find more info about directives in the Angular Docs link below:
